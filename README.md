Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Daniel Besong, and this is where I share my coding projects, experiments, and contributions.

## About Me

* **Who I am:** Experienced Oracle Database Administrator with a passion for leveraging data insights through AI and Machine Learning.
* **Interests:** Oracle Database Administration, Data Warehousing, Data Analysis, Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, AI ethics, Cloud Computing (specifically AWS and Azure for data and AI services).
* **Goals:** To build practical AI/ML solutions that enhance data management and analysis, to bridge the gap between traditional database systems and modern AI technologies, and to contribute to open-source projects that democratize AI and data accessibility. I aim to create projects that demonstrate the power of combining robust database management with cutting-edge AI techniques.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects you'll find in my repositories:

* **[Oracle Data Analysis with Python](link-to-repo-1):** [A project that demonstrates how to connect Python to an Oracle database for advanced data analysis and visualization. Highlight key technologies used, such as `cx_Oracle`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.]
    * Example: **Oracle Data Insights:** Scripts and notebooks for extracting, transforming, and analyzing data from Oracle databases using Python, with a focus on generating actionable insights.
* **[Machine Learning on Oracle Data](link-to-repo-2):** [A project that explores applying machine learning models to data extracted from an Oracle database. Highlight key technologies used, such as `scikit-learn` or `TensorFlow`.]
    * Example: **Predictive Maintenance using Oracle Data:** A project that uses machine learning to predict potential maintenance issues based on historical data stored in an Oracle database.
* **[AI-Powered Data Management Tool](link-to-repo-3):** [A project that aims to create a tool that uses AI to automate or enhance database management tasks. Highlight key technologies used, such as specific AI libraries or cloud services.]
    * Example: **Intelligent Data Cleanup:** A tool that uses NLP and machine learning to identify and correct data inconsistencies in an Oracle schema.

## Technologies
